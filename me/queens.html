                <h4>Simple Introduction</h4>
                <p>"Queens is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Queens County, in the U.S. state of New York. Located near the western end of Long Island, it is the largest of the five New York City boroughs by area. It is bordered by the borough of Brooklyn and by Nassau County to its east, and shares maritime borders with the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, as well as with New Jersey. Queens is the most linguistically and ethnically diverse place in the world."</p>

                <h4>My neighborhood</h4>
                <p>I live in Little Neck, Queens. The surrounding landscape and scenery is pretty peaceful. There is a small playground as well as a railroad train station within walking distance that goes to Manhattan so it's a convenient location. I went to elementary and middle school in the same area.</p>

                    <h2>Firewalls</h2>
                    <p>Firewalls sit between a private network and general internet traffic. They filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on a list of security rules to block potentially malicious traffic from leaving or entering a network. If malware somehow does get onto a device on the network, firewalls can also potentially help prevent malware from spreading within a network. Most home routers have firewall functions built-in and most computers have software firewalls. Businesses may also have a specialized standalone physical firewall device to filter traffic going in and out of their infrastructure.</p>

                    <h2>Antivirus/AntiMalware</h2>
                    <p>Antivirus and anti-malware are software programs for identifying and blocking viruses/malware on your computer. These software scan files and monitor the computer for suspicious activities to detect all types of malware. Antivirus stores a list of known malicious file signatures, which are the hash values of malware programs. The antivirus scans files downloaded and on the computer to see if any local files match a malicious signature. Because antivirus/anti-malware relies on a constantly updated list of malicious signatures, antiviruses must be updated frequently to be effective.</p>

                    <h2>VPN</h2>
                    <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) secures communication between 2 networks by encrypting the traffic between them. When unencrypted traffic is intercepted it can be read easily whereas encrypted traffic is not in human-readable language even if intercepted. The VPN software on a client device connects to a VPN concentrator in the network the client wants to communicate with. A tunnel is created between the VPN concentrator and the client device where all traffic is encrypted. There are 2 common types of VPN setup, full tunnel and split tunnel. In a full tunnel configuration, all traffic is sent between the VPN concentrator and the client device. In a split tunnel configuration, only the traffic needed to be sent to devices on the VPN concentratorâ€™s network is sent over the secure tunnel while other traffic is sent directly from the client device to the internet. </p>

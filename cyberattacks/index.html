            <h1>About CyberAttacks</h1>
    
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practices and technologies used to protect computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from unauthorized access or damage. People rely heavily on the internet for many things such as texting, shopping, and data storage. As a result more and more of our valuable information and data is getting uploaded to the internet. This means more and more malicious actors are incentivized to steal that information and profit from it. There are many ways and techniques a malicious actor can go about stealing confidential information or causing havoc in the digital world. Thus, the significance of cybersecurity is continuously growing with our use and development of technology as more of our information or data becomes exposed to areas for attack.</p>
